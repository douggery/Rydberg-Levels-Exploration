# Rydberg-Levels-Exploration
Rydberg energy levels in Rb (and Cs)

One class of atomic device is a Rydberg sensor
which can detect faint RF, microwave, and THz fields. 

The field sensitivity and resonant frequency depend on the coupling laser
choice and the appropriate excited states chosen.

In a NASA project evaluating a widely tunable set of lasers
for Rydberg excitation, we identified which transitions would enable
S-band and K-band detection for cyrospheric flow measurements from space.

The probe and coupling lasers are tuned to achieve a Rydberg excitation with
principle quantum number n. The energy separation between two relevant states (yellow)
is plotted vs n. The last graph depicts the decreasing dipole moment of 
the excitation coupling laser which necessitates more laser power
by Fermi's Golden Rule to drive the transition successfully.
