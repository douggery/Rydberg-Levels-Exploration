# Rydberg-Levels-Exploration
Rydberg energy levels in Rb (and Cs)

One class of atomic device is a Rydberg sensor
which can detect faint RF, microwave, and THz fields. 

The field sensitivity and resonant frequency depend on the coupling laser
choice and the appropriate excited states chosen.

In a NASA project evaluating a widely tunable set of lasers
for Rydberg excitation, we identified which transitions would enable
S-band and K-band detection for cyrospheric flow measurements from space.
